# peripherals-nix-configuration
This repository contains nix configurations for my peripheral devices in my home network. In case there is a new device or an old one had to be reset to factory settings, these configurations should bring the device's system to my desired working state with one or two nix commands instead of installing my standard programs again from scratch.
